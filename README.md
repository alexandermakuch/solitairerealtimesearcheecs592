# EECS592 Course Project: Searching Solitaire in Real Time
Course project for EECS592: Artificial Intelligence Foundations, Fall 2021.

## Abstract
For this project, we proposed using real-time search on the game Thoughtful Solitaire, a variation of Klondike Solitaire in which the location of all cards are known, as done in SEARCHING SOLITAIRE IN REAL TIME [http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~afern/papers/solitaire.pdf]. 
The system that we implemented is a Thoughtful Solitaire solver. This system takes the input of an initial state for the game, and outputs the actions leading to the goal state for the game, or determines that the game is unwinnable.

## How to Run

Run main.py. There are comments at the end, above the function call that give insight into options for you to choose what to test.
